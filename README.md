# dogs-classifier-renet50


The Jupyter Notebook "DogClassifier_v2.ipynb" is the submission to Part 1 of Assignment.

The Python File "app.py" is the submission for the Part 2 of Assignment. The API is developed using Flask Framework and is REST based.
I was not able to deploy the API due to less free storage. (Tried on Heroku free tier). I have tested the API locally and it works.

The File "requirements.txt" has the list of packages required.
